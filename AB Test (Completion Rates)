# Compare Funnels For A/B Tests

# Mattresses and More has an onboarding workflow for new users of their website. It uses modal pop-ups to welcome users and show them important features of the site like:

    1. Welcome to Mattresses and More!
    2. Browse our bedding selection
    3. Select items to add to your cart
    4. View your cart by clicking on the icon
    5. Press ‘Buy Now!’ when you’re ready to checkout

# The Product team at Mattresses and More has created a new design for the pop-ups that they believe will lead more users to complete the workflow.

# They’ve set up an A/B test where:

    - 50% of users view the original control version of the pop-ups
    - 50% of users view the new variant version of the pop-ups

# The data table is called onboarding_modals with the following columns:

    - user_id - the user identifier
    - modal_text - the modal step
    - user_action - the user response (Close Modal or Continue)
    - ab_group - the version (control or variant)

# Below is my solution to the question: How is the funnel different between the two groups?

WITH funnel_CTE AS (
  -- First we summarize how many users make it to each modal_text between the two controlled groups.
  SELECT 
          modal_text
        , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
                              WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
                          END) AS 'control_clicks'
        , COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
                              WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
                          END) AS 'variant_clicks'
  FROM onboarding_modals
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1
) 

SELECT
        modal_text
      , control_clicks
      , variant_clicks
      -- We can now calculate the completion rates between the two controlled groups by dividing the user counts at each level by the total user counts
      , (100.0 * control_clicks / FIRST_VALUE(control_clicks) OVER (ORDER BY modal_text)) || '%' as cc_completion_rate
      , (100.0 * variant_clicks / FIRST_VALUE(variant_clicks) OVER (ORDER BY modal_text)) || '%' as vc_completion_rate

# We have a browse table that shows browse date of the website by user_id and assigns a 1 or 0 for users that have made it to the checkout page and successfully made a purchase.
# The assignment of the 1 or 0 depending on checkout or purchase activity comes from the checkut and purchase tables that include the date, user_id, and item_id.
